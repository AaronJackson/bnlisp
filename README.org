* bnlisp, a lisp for 2.11BSD

bnl (Marc Cleave) was a fan of, among other things, Lisp, PDP-11s and
UNIX. In bnlisp, we try to encapsulate some of these interests by
encapsulating them into a lisp interpreter which runs on the PDP-11
under 2.11BSD.

It is currently full of memory leaks, so, enjoy.

A small example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ./lisp
welcome to bnlisp
(SETQ PDP 11)
(PRINT (CONS (QUOTE THE)
	     (CONS (QUOTE PDP)
		   (CONS PDP  (CONS (QUOTE IS)
				    (CONS (QUOTE COOL) NIL))))))
 INPUT: (SETQ PDP 11)
OUTPUT: 11


 INPUT: (PRINT (CONS (QUOTE THE) (CONS (QUOTE PDP) (CONS PDP (CONS (QUOTE IS) (CONS (QUOTE COOL) NIL))))))
(THE PDP 11 IS COOL)
OUTPUT: (THE PDP 11 IS COOL)

#+END_SRC

We all miss you bnl :heart:
